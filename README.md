# A Breakable Toy for Computer Science and Related Domains

This is a breakable toy project created for learning and playing with topics in Computer Science and
related domains. Emphasis on _breakable_. While I'm fairly diligent with keeping things in working
order, both the source and the documentation are subject to inconsistencies and failing states that
will not be prioritized in the forseeable future.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run start
```

Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) with your browser to see the result. Depending
on which ports are available, the port might be different. Refer to console output for details.
