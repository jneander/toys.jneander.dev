This exercise uses a genetic algorithm to place queen pieces on a chess board in such a way that no
one queen is able to attack any of the others. The original puzzle is for a standard 8x8 chess
board. Here it can be based on a board sized from a minimum of 4x4 up to an arbitrary limit of
20x20. Each variation uses a number of queens equal to the count of squares in one row on the board.

This exercise came from Chapter 4 of
[Genetic Algorithms with Python](https://github.com/handcraftsman/GeneticAlgorithmsWithPython#description)
by [Clinton Sheppard](https://www.cs.unm.edu/~sheppard/). In the book, it is referred to as "The 8
Queens Puzzle."
