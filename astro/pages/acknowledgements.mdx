I'd like to thank [Cary Huang](https://twitter.com/realcarykh) for his
[Evolution Simulator videos on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrUdxfaFpuuK0rj55Rhc187Tn9vvxck7t).
Those videos captivated me and got me thinking about things I could explore with system simulations
in code. It's because of him that I started fiddling with genetic algorithms and related interests.
Huge thanks for [encouraging derivative works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YBY4yLfw4g) and
inviting folks to share in your excitement!

I've also gained much from
[Genetic Algorithms with Python](https://github.com/handcraftsman/GeneticAlgorithmsWithPython#description)
by [Clinton Sheppard](https://www.cs.unm.edu/~sheppard/). Clinton's guidance taught me about
implementations and obstacles with genetic algorithms.

Finally, my deepest thanks goes to [Adrian Herbez](http://www.adrianherbez.net/) for first teaching
me how to go beyond just hacking on code and on to _developing_ software. He engaged the
problem-solving part of my brain so thoroughly that it changed the course of my life.
