In 2015, Cary Huang published some videos to YouTube showing an evolution simulator he was working
on.

- [Evolution Simulator (Part 1)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFws_hhZs8)
- [Evolution Simulator (Part 2)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31dsH2Fs1IQ)
- [Evolution Simulator (Part 3)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVcvvqxtNwE)
- [Evolution Simulator (Part 4)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrTbJUJsDSw)

In 2016, he posted some followups with enhancements to his evolution simulator.

- [Evolution Simulator of Creatures Doing MATH (Part 1)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7pNUxmDfug)
- [Evolution Simulator of Untwitchy Creatures Doing MATH (Part 2)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmnFVuHNWZ8)

He also open-sourced the simulator on [OpenProcessing](https://openprocessing.org/) as
[ACTUALLY Improved Evolution Simulator](https://openprocessing.org/sketch/377698). Adhering to the
[Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported (CC BY-SA 3.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/)
license, I ported and refactored his implementation into that which is presented here.
