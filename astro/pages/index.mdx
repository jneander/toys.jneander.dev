I love learning things. I love those moments when something just CLICKS and the brain sees things
differently forever thereafter. We all need more moments like those. Rather than sit around and wait
for them to come to me, I go looking for them!

I look for new ideas and things to learn wherever I go. When I'd like to dig deeper into something—a
concept, a craft, etc.—I find that building something around it helps me to navigate the ideas
contained within.

This site is all about those pursuits. Here are some of my breakable toys.

## What is a breakable toy?

A "breakable toy" is a small, simple project or piece of code for experimenting with tools and learn
new skills. It is purposely limited and not tied to the success of other projects, which means we
can make mistakes and break things without real consequences. In other words, breakable toys give us
the freedom to fail. Rather, they encourage it!

The term is found in the book <cite>[Apprenticeship Patterns](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/apprenticeship-patterns/9780596806842/)</cite> by [Dave Hoover](https://redsquirrel.com/dave/) and [Adewale Oshineye](https://www.oreilly.com/pub/au/3421).

  Failure is often the best way to learn anything. Only by attempting to do bold
  things, failing, learning from that failure, and trying again do we grow into
  the kind of people who can succeed when faced with difficult problems.

Breakable toys provide a means to learning and reinforcing what's learned. Being small, they provide
a shorter feedback loop than a typical work project. They can be a useful tool for developing skills
and building confidence.

  We can all benefit by doing occasional 'toy' programs, when artificial restrictions are set up,
  so that we are forced to push our abilities to the limit.

It ought to be emphasized that “breakable” implies that things are sometimes broken. These toys
might not be working right sometimes, or at all. It's all part of the process.

## These toys are for sharing.

Breakable toys make for great exercise, stretching and building creative problem-solving muscles.
But I also think they're downright fun. And fun is for sharing!
