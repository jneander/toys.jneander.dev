This algorithm splits a group of playing cards, faces of ace through ten (values 1 through 10), into
two groups such that the sum of one group is 36 and the product of the second group is 360.

I'm unsure where this originated. I suspect it came from a puzzle book, but I haven't been able to
find the source or even identify this puzzle or the type of puzzle.
