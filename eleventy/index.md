I've long been fascinated by the idea of replicating the mechanics of life in a simulated
environment. At [Academy of Art University](https://www.academyart.edu/), I was a student of
technical computer animation. Among many technical direction classes, I enjoyed a class using
[Massive](https://www.massivesoftware.com/), crowd simulation software that was originally developed
for the The Lord of the Rings trilogy. While the purpose of that software was more along the lines
of fascimile rather than simulation, I leaned into an understanding of crowd mechanics and favored
the pursuit of life simulations.
